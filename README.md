# TelegramNotifier_for_BookMyShow
I made a telegram bot, hosted it on heroku, scraped the Book My Show website for the required date for Spiderman NWH shows, collected the class id for the same, and triggered notifications on telegram for every minute.<br /><br />


Used https://www.toptal.com/python/telegram-bot-tutorial-python for making bots and hosting them <br />
Used https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/ for learning web scraping <br />
Status of working of the bot can be checked on https://chull-hull.herokuapp.com/ <br />
